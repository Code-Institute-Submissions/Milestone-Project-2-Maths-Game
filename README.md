# Multiplication Game
Having worked as a teacher for many years, I feel that knowing times table is a really important basis for learning more challenging maths. This game allows children (or an adult who wants to improve their times tables skills) to practice specific times tables and also to challenge themselves against the clock on random times tables. Times tables need to be committed to long-term memory and the only way to do this is through repetition. This game allows for that repetition and gives scores and challenges in order to motivate the user.

## UX
This game is aimed at children who can use the website to improve their times tables skills. Of course, adults can use it as well. Many times tables websites are flash games which do help to motivate the child but have the issues of: 
- Little control over which times table to practice.
- Use of flash is not available very easily on iPads.
- Levels are not differentiated.
- Games websites often have heavy advertising which a child can inadvertantly click on. 


This website could be used:
- By a child at home wanting to do some extra times tables practice.
- By a teacher teaching a whole class with the game on the interactive whiteboard. For example, if they are working, as a class, on their 2x table, they could have little game to see which team can score the most points.
- By a child in an IT suite or on a tablet with the teacher overseeing.

User stories:
- As a teacher, I want a quick and easy way to practice times tables with my class.
- As a teacher, I want differentiated levels of challenge.
- As a teacher and user I want the ability to control what times table the class/ I practice.
- As a user, I want to see a score as I get correct answers so that I can compete with my peers.
- As a user I want to learn from my mistakes.
- As a user, I want to navigate easily through the website.
